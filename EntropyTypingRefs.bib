	abstract = {The idea that cognition is controlled hierarchically is appealing to many but is difficult to demonstrate empirically. Often, nonhierarchical theories can account for the data as well as hierarchical ones do. The purpose of this chapter is to document the case for hierarchical control in skilled typing and present it as an example of a strategy for demonstrating hierarchical control in other cognitive acts. We propose that typing is controlled by two nested feedback loops that can be distinguished in terms of the factors that affect them, that communicate through intermediate representations (words), that know little about how each other work, and rely on different kinds of feedback. We discuss hierarchical control in other skills; the relation between hierarchical control and familiar concepts like automaticity, procedural memory, and implicit knowledge; and the development of hierarchical skills. We end with speculations about the role of hierarchical control in everyday cognition and the search for a meaningful life.},

	abstract = {In 1952, W. E. Hick published an article in the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, “On the rate of gain of information.” It played a seminal role in the cognitive revolution and established one of the few widely acknowledged laws in psychology, relating choice reaction time to the number of stimulus–response alternatives (or amount of uncertainty) in a task. We review the historical context in which Hick conducted his study and describe his experiments and theoretical analyses. We discuss the article’s immediate impact on researchers, as well as challenges to and shortcomings of Hick’s law and his analysis, including effects of stimulus–response compatibility, practice, very large set sizes and sequential dependencies. Contemporary modeling developments are also described in detail. Perhaps most impressive about Hick’s law is that it continues to spawn research efforts to the present and that it is regarded as a fundamental law of interface design for human–computer interaction using technologies that did not exist at the time of Hick’s research.},

	abstract = {Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) is an online crowdsourcing service where anonymous online workers complete web-based tasks for small sums of money. The service has attracted attention from experimental psychologists interested in gathering human subject data more efficiently. However, relative to traditional laboratory studies, many aspects of the testing environment are not under the experimenter’s control. In this paper, we attempt to empirically evaluate the fidelity of the AMT system for use in cognitive behavioral experiments. These types of experiment differ from simple surveys in that they require multiple trials, sustained attention from participants, comprehension of complex instructions, and millisecond accuracy for response recording and stimulus presentation. We replicate a diverse body of tasks from experimental psychology including the Stroop, Switching, Flanker, Simon, Posner Cuing, attentional blink, subliminal priming, and category learning tasks using participants recruited using AMT. While most of replications were qualitatively successful and validated the approach of collecting data anonymously online using a web-browser, others revealed disparity between laboratory results and online results. A number of important lessons were encountered in the process of conducting these replications that should be of value to other researchers.},

This view of mental architecture is consistent with the historical tradition of faculty psychology while integrating a computational approach to mental processes.
