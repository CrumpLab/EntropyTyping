Matthew J. C. Crump, Walter Lai, Nicholaus P. Brosowsky

Status: **Mansucript in Draft**, last compiled: `r Sys.Date()`

This is an open and reproducible project written in R Markdown, including .rmd files for analysis, and .rmd files to compile the paper in APA format using papaja (for .pdf), and this R Markdown website. In principle the source code and open data contained in the project repository should be sufficient for compiling and reproducing this paper.

This paper is has been submitted for publication at the Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology, and is currently in the review process.

In addition to this website, pre-print versions of this paper have been submitted to psyarxiv.com [https://psyarxiv.com/keufc/](https://psyarxiv.com/keufc/), and the github repository has been archived with a DOI at the open-science frame work, [https://osf.io/bdnqr/](https://osf.io/bdnqr/), (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/BDNQR).
