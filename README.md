# EntropyTyping

This is an open and reproducible project being written in public on Github. The entire project is written in R Markdown, including .rmd files for analysis, and .rmd files to compile the paper in APA format using papaja (for .pdf), and this R Markdown website. In principle the source code and open data contained in this project repository should be sufficient for compiling and reproducing the paper.
