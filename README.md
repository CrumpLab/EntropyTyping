# EntropyTyping
A repository for collaborating on our new manuscript investigating how keystroke dynamics conform to information theoretic measures of entropy in the letters people type.

We are attempting to use github as a collaborative platform for members of the lab to contribute to writing up this paper. The record of how we complete our project will be saved in the changelog for this repo. After we are done, this repo should contain

1. A pre-print of our manuscript (written using papaja in R)
2. Databases used for the analyses
3. R-scripts used for the analyses
4. Hopefully some discussion of the things in our paper within the issues. Collaborators will be encouraged to have conversations about things that need be changed, added, tried out, etc. using the issues tab. Whether this catches on remains to be seen.
